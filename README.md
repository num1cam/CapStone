# Savvy Coders Data Analytics Capstone Project
Welcome to a comprehensive overview of our real estate data analysis project, where we've delved deep into the 2023 sales data for townhomes and condos across various counties. This project showcases a fusion of analytical and technical skills, employing data preparation techniques, statistical analysis, and advanced visualization tools like Tableau. We meticulously cleaned and organized the data, focusing on key metrics such as sales volume, average list prices, and average sold prices. Our approach involved not just numerical analysis but also a keen understanding of real estate market dynamics and trends, enabling us to extract meaningful insights and make informed recommendations for potential real estate investments.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the project's components:

Data Preparation and Cleaning: We selected and organized relevant data for townhomes and condos, specifically focusing on sales in 2023. This included the number of sales, average list prices, and average sold prices.

Analysis: Our analysis identified top counties for townhome and condo sales, with Fulton, Cobb, and DeKalb Counties emerging as key areas. These counties showed the highest sales volumes and significant average sold prices, indicating robust real estate markets and potential for investment.

Insights and Observations: We observed that townhomes generally have a higher sales volume than condos, suggesting a greater market demand for townhomes. Fulton County notably excelled in both townhome and condo sales.

Investment Recommendations: Based on the data, we recommend considering Fulton, Cobb, and DeKalb counties as promising areas for real estate investments, particularly in townhomes due to their higher sales volume.

Visualization in Tableau: To effectively communicate our findings, we plan to use bar charts, price comparison charts, and maps (subject to the availability of geographical data) in Tableau.

Challenges: The project presented challenges, potentially in data analysis, interpretation, or visualization, which were addressed to ensure accurate and insightful conclusions.

Conclusion: Our analysis provided a nuanced understanding of sales volumes and market dynamics, essential for making informed investment decisions. We focused on identifying current market hotspots while also considering areas showing sustainable growth potential.

This project is a testament to the power of combining data analysis with market insight, harnessing the strength of both to guide strategic investment decisions in the dynamic world of real estate.
