Good morning everyone, my name is Drew, and it's a pleasure to be here today to share the culmination of my enriching experience at the Savvy Coders Bootcamp. Residing in North Atlanta, I balance my life as a dedicated husband and father of three with a diverse professional background that spans several dynamic roles. My journey has taken me from the disciplined life of a retired army veteran to the fast-paced world of real estate, shaping me into who I am today: a Business Analyst, an Entrepreneur, and a perpetual student of personal development, technology, and self-improvement.

My time in the military equipped me with vital skills in leadership, problem-solving, and analytical thinking. These skills were further refined in my role as a realtor, where understanding and meeting client needs was paramount. Driven by a desire to continually grow and make a more impactful contribution, I embarked on a new adventure with Savvy Coders Bootcamp. This program has not only broadened my technical skillset with advanced tools like Tableau, SQL, and Python, but it has also offered me the opportunity to step into the role of a product manager, overseeing projects with a keen eye for detail and efficiency.

Today, I stand before you not just as a student presenting his work but as an individual who has faced and overcome significant challenges, including battling PTSD. This journey has been about transformation, resilience, and acquiring a diverse set of skills. I've dived into the complexities of web scraping using Pandas, explored the depths of SQL queries, and mastered the art of data visualization with Tableau, all while leading projects with the strategic mindset of a product manager in an agile environment.

My ambition now is to blend these newly acquired technical abilities with my existing skills to foster a community centered around life and business coaching. With a broad knowledge base that includes technology, fitness, anatomy, psychology, marketing, and spirituality, I am committed to helping others remain focused and eliminate distractions. Through my initiatives in podcasts, YouTube, and writing, I aim to inspire and guide individuals in unlocking and maximizing their natural talents.

So, let me now take you through my project at Savvy Coders Bootcamp, a reflection of the dedication, hard work, and relentless pursuit of personal and professional growth that has characterized my journey. Thank you for being part of this pivotal moment in my career.

I'll be presenting a comprehensive analysis of the 2023 townhome and condo sales across various counties. This analysis is pivotal for identifying key investment opportunities in the real estate market."

Data Overview:
"Let's begin by looking at the datasets we have. We have extensive sales data for townhomes in 2023, covering the number of sales, average list price, and average sold price. Similarly, we have data for condos, as well as information on active listings and properties under contract across multiple counties. A challenge we faced was the 'GaCounty2023' file, which didn't specify the property type, leading us to focus primarily on townhome and condo data."

Data Preparation:
"Preparing this data for analysis involved meticulously cleaning and selecting relevant columns. We ensured the data was clear and concise, focusing on the number of sales, average list prices, and sold prices. This was crucial for an accurate and insightful analysis."

Analysis and Insights:
"Moving to the analysis, let's delve into what the data tells us. We identified the counties with the highest volume of sales for both townhomes and condos. For instance, in Fulton County, we observed 122 townhome sales with an average sold price of $510,041. Similarly, condo sales in Fulton County topped the charts with 160 sales at an average price of $475,215. These figures suggest a robust and active real estate market in Fulton County, indicating it as a potential hotspot for investment."
(  Talk about code  tell story about dilemmas code snippet is a Python dictionary named file_paths that stores a collection of file paths, each associated with a unique key. This dictionary is likely used in a Python script or program for data analysis or manipulation. Each key in the dictionary is a descriptive name for a dataset, and the corresponding value is the file path to a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file on the user's computer.

Here's a breakdown of the dictionary:

Each key (like 'GaCounty2023', 'GaCountyActive', etc.) is a shorthand reference or label for a specific dataset.
The values are raw strings (denoted by the r before the quotes) that represent the file paths to the respective CSV files. Raw strings are often used for file paths in Python to avoid issues with escape characters like the backslash (\).
For example, the key 'GaCounty2023' points to a file path "C:\\Users\\aries\\code\\savvycoders\\Capstone\\All Data\\GaCounty 2023.csv". This file path indicates that the file named GaCounty 2023.csv is located in the All Data folder, which is under the Capstone folder in the savvy coders directory, and so on.

The user of this dictionary can easily access the file paths by referring to these keys in their code, which makes it more convenient to load or reference these datasets in data analysis tasks, such as reading the files into a data processing library like pandas. )

Market Dynamics:
"Our analysis also revealed interesting market dynamics. For example, the general trend shows a higher sales volume for townhomes compared to condos, hinting at a stronger market demand for townhomes in these areas. Such insights are vital for understanding market preferences and directing investment strategies accordingly."

Challenges Faced:
"Throughout this analysis, one of the challenges was to ensure data accuracy and relevance, especially when handling large datasets with varying property types. However, with careful data management and analysis strategies, we overcame these hurdles."

Visualizations in Tableau:
"To better visualize our findings, we utilized Tableau. We created bar charts to illustrate the top counties by sales volume and price comparison charts to juxtapose the average sold prices for townhomes and condos. If geographical data was available, mapping these sales would have added layer of insight."

Conclusion and Recommendations:
"In conclusion, our analysis using Tableau offers valuable insights for potential investors. Counties like Fulton, Cobb, and DeKalb emerge as promising areas for investment in townhomes and condos. Understanding the nuances of the market dynamics, such as pricing trends and property type preferences, is essential for informed decision-making. This analysis not only highlights where the most sales are happening but also sheds light on sustainable growth opportunities and market trends crucial for strategic investment."

"Thank you for your attention. I'm now open to any questions or discussions regarding this analysis."
